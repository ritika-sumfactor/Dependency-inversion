Search Engine Optimization
The goal of SEO is to create a strategy that will increase your rankings position in search engine results. The higher the ranking, the more organic traffic to your site.
SEO is the key to increased conversion and confidence in your brand. Higher search ranking placement equates to more organic visitors. Search engine organic traffic – visitors who come to your site through clicking a result in a search engine – is key to many businesses for three reasons:
Qualitative – Increased chance that visitors turn into customers.
Trustable – Higher confidence in your brand or mission.
Low-Cost – Aside from the time and effort spent, having good SEO practices that result in higher search engine ranking is free. There is no direct cost to appear in top organic search results positions.

Three Pillars of Optimization
The process of optimizing a website can be divided into three main pillars:
Technical – Optimize your website for crawling and web performance.
Creation – Create a content strategy to target specific keywords.
Popularity – Boost your site's presence online so search engines know you are a trusted source. This is done through the use of backlinks – third-party sites that link back to your site.

IMPLEMENT STATIC GET PROP AND GET STATIC PATH IN NEXT.JS
There are the two different routes Route0 & Route1
The route 0 contains another content at the same time route 1 contains some othr content
The U se Router is used to get the router query id.
The get static prop allows to access params which is equivalent to the static prop.params it can be destructed.
Documentation : We nee dto return a path it returns params id value it is an array of object.

Fallback Key: it is the key though which we can see what happens when you try to enetr id that does not exits.

Fallback: False with 404 page
if the page of the route value is 300, 500 whatever the dynamic value it does exists when changed from route 1 to 300 it returns an error of 404. It is because it is not the part of get static path.
