*Routing in nextjs
>Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages.
>When a file is added to the pages directory, it's automatically available as a route.
>The files inside the pages directory can be used to define most common patterns
*Implementation for the back to home link :
in the anchor tag write back to home and then checking it out there
in a linmk component when use it in route in different pages it is not changing the page the only thing happens is it changes the route
The problem related to the routing part in there Create a route called localhost:3000/courses/nextjs so you should be able to route to localhost:3000/courses/nextjs and we should see a page rendered there with as text and then we were suppose toCreate a dynamic route in the pages directory at localhost:3000 so you should be able go to localhost:3000/<dynamic-route> where dynamic-route.
